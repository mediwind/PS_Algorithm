### 문제 설명

<ul>
	<li>“I’m stopping by Žnidaršić’s house, you play the piano, Perica.”</li>
	<li>”Ok, dad, I will!”</li>
</ul>

<p>And so, Perica began playing the piano. His piano consists of N keys. Each key has a value written on it, a<sub>i</sub>. When Perica plays the piano, he presses exactly K different keys at the same time. The piano is a bit strange because, after pressing K keys at the same time, it will play only the key with the largest value. Perica is going to play each combination of K keys on the piano and he wants to know the sum of values of the keys that will be played.</p>

<p>Help Perica determine the remainder of that number modulo 1 000 000 007.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains two integers N and K (1 ≤ N ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ K ≤ 50).</p>

<p>The following line of input contains N integers a<sub>i</sub> (0 ≤ a<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The first and only line of output must contain the required number from the task.</p>
