### 문제 설명

<p>Industrious Farmer John wants a build a four-sided fence to enclose the cows. He has one plank of wood of integer length N (4 <= N <= 2,500) that he wants to cut at three points to make four integer-length pieces.</p>

<p>The four pieces can be of any positive integer length as long as Farmer John can form a quadrilateral fence with them. How many different ways can he cut the plank of wood so that he can make a complete fence?</p>

<p>NOTES:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Two ways of cutting are different if one has a cut at a spot that the other doesn't. Don't worry about eliminating symmetries or other complexities like that.</li>
	<li>Do make sure, though, that the fence has greater than 0 area.</li>
	<li>Rejoice that the answer will always fit into a signed 32-bit integer.</li>
</ul>

### 입력
