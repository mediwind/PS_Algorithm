### 문제 설명

<p>Hank Morebooks is famous writer. He has already decided what his new book would be, but he has not come up with names for k of its characters. As for all his previous books, he would use the following way to generate names. He first creates a string of English letters, and then divides it to k different non-empty parts. Help Hank to find out if it is possible to divide the given string into k different names.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Input data contains several test cases. The first line of the input data contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).</p>

<p>Each test is described with two lines: the first line is the string to be divided, its length is at most 100. It contains only lowercase English letters. The second line contains integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 5) — the number of parts that the given string must be divided to.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print answer for each test case as described below.</p>

<p>If it is possible to divide the given string into k different non-empty parts, print "YES" as the first line of output. Then print k strings — the parts. Concatenated in order of output parts must form the input string.</p>

<p>If it is impossible to divide the given string as required, output "NO" for this test case.</p>
