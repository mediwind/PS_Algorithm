### 문제 설명

<p>There’s no doubt about it, three is a magical number. Two’s company, but three’s a crowd, no one ever talks about 2 blind mice, and there are three members in an ACM ICPC team.</p>

<p>Even more magically, almost all integers can be represented as a number that ends in 3 in some numeric base, sometimes in more than one way. Consider the number 11, which is represented as 13 in base 8 and 23 in base 4. For this problem, you will find the smallest base for a given number so that the number’s representation in that base ends in 3.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Each line of the input contains one nonnegative integer n. The value n = 0 represents the end of the input and should not be processed. All input integers are less than 2<sup>31</sup>. There are no more than 1 000 nonzero values of n.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each nonzero value of n in the input, print on a single line the smallest base for which the number has a representation that ends in 3. If there is no such base, print instead “No such base”.</p>
